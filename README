This repository is the collection of source codes grouped by programming languages by which I have examined some libraries/frameworks/etc.
These aren't the real projects, just ignore them.

embedded_perl - embedding perl into the multithreaded c program
inotify_test  - a simple usage example of inotify for fs change tracking
